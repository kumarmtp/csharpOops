In c#, we have two different kinds of polymorphisms available, those are

 

Compile Time Polymorphism
Run Time Polymorphism

C# Compile Time Polymorphism

In c#, Compile Time Polymorphism means defining multiple methods 
with the same name but with different parameters. Using compile-time polymorphism, 
we can perform different tasks with the same method name by passing different parameters.

 

In c#, the compile-time polymorphism can be achieved by using method overloading, 
and it is also called early binding or static binding.
