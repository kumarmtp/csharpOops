//    C# Static Class Features
//    Following are the main features of static class in c# programming language.

 

//    The static class in c# will contain only static members.
//    In c#, the static classes cannot be instantiated.
//    C# static classes are sealed, so they cannot be inherited.
//    The static classes in c# will not contain instance constructors.

//    we can use static members in non-static classes such as normal classes.
//    For normal classes, you can create an instance of a class using 
//        the new keyword to access non-static members and functions, 
//    but it cannot access the static members and functions.
